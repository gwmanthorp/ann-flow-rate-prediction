# Flow Rate Multi-Layer Perceptron ANN
A Python-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, built from scratch, to forecast daily river flow rates. This project implements the backpropagation algorithm with advanced enhancements like Momentum, Bold Driver, and Weight Decay for improved accuracy and training efficiency.
